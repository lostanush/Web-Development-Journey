Full-Stack Web App • Next.js · React · Axios · Express.js · CORS · Git/GitHub
Jun 2025

Developed a Next.js frontend that fetches and renders JSON data (messages, user info, dynamic item lists) via Axios and React hooks (useEffect, useState).

Built a CORS‑enabled Express.js backend on port 3001 to serve structured JSON endpoints (res.json()), including message, timestamp, user, and items.

Applied semantic JSX for ordered list rendering (<ol> with <li>) and robust error handling in both frontend (.catch) and backend.

Streamlined Git workflow by removing nested submodule, initializing a root main branch, configuring remote, and pushing to GitHub.
